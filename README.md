Provide cachers to the model so that you could specify which you want to cache. Data will be cached at `Rails.cache` and also at application level via `RequestStore` to cache values between requests. Cachers will maintain cached objects and expire them when they are changed (including create, update, destroy, and even delete).

- [Multi-level Cache](#multi-level-cache)
- Do not pollute original ActiveModel API.
- Support ActiveRecord 3, 4, 5.
- High test coverage


## Compare with [identity_cache](https://github.com/Shopify/identity_cache)

`active_model_cachers` allows you to specify what to cache and when to expire those caches. So that you could cache raw sql query results, time-consuming methods, responses of requests, and so on. It also supports AR associations / attibutes (has_many, has_one, belongs_to) and secondary indexes.

`identity_cache` focuses on AR, and doesn't have the flexibility to specify the query. It has more features for caching AR associations / attibutes, such as caching attibutes by multiple keys, embedding associations to load data in one fetch, non-unique secondary indexes, and caching polymorphic associations, etc.

There is also a difference worths mentioning, `active_model_cachers` encapsulated methods to `cacher`, while `identity_cache` adds a number of `fetch_*` method to `AR` directly. Therefore, it's more possible to have method name collision.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_model_cachers'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_model_cachers

Add an initializer with this code to your project:

```rb
ActiveModelCachers.config do |config|
  config.store = Rails.cache # specify where the cache will be stored
end
```

## Usage

### Cache whatever you want by `cache_at` method

`cache_at(name, query = nil, options = {})`

Specify a cache on the model.
 - name: the attribute name.
 - query: how to get data on cache miss. It will be set automatically if the name match an association or an attribute.
 - options: see [here](#options)

### Asscess the cached attributes

The `cacher` is defined as `class method` and `instance method` of Model. You could call the method and get the cacher instance, e.g. `User.cacher` or `user.cacher`. An attribute will define a method on cacher, cached attributes are asscessable via it, e.g. `user.cacher.the_attribute_name`.


### Basic Example
```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  cache_at :something_you_want_to_cache, ->{ get_the_data_on_cache_miss }
end

user.cacher.something_you_want_to_cache
```


## Examples

### Example 1: Cache the number of active user

After specifying the name as `active_count` and how to get data when cache miss by lambda `User.active.count`.
You could access the cached data by calling `active_count` method on the cacher, `User.cacher`.

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  scope :active, ->{ where('last_login_at > ?', 7.days.ago) }
 Â cache_at :active_count, ->{ active.count }, expire_by: 'User#last_login_at'
end

@count = User.cacher.active_count
```

You may want to flush cache on the number of active user changed. It can be done by simply setting [`expire_by`](#expire_by). In this case, `User#last_login_at` means flushing the cache when a user's `last_login_at` is changed (whenever by save, update, create, destroy or delete).

### Example 2: Cache the number of user

In this example, the cache should be cleaned on user `destroyed`, or new user `created`, but not on user `updated`. You could specify the cleaning callback to only fire on certain events by [`on`](#on).

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  cache_at :count, ->{ count }, expire_by: 'User', on: [:create, :destroy]
end

@count = User.cacher.count
```

### Example 3: Access the cacher from a model instance

You could use the cacher from instance scope, e.g. `user.cacher`, instead of `User.cacher`. The difference is that the `binding` of query lambda is changed. In this example, you could write the query as `posts.exists?` in that it's in instance scope, and the binding of the lambda is `user`, not `User`. So that it accesses `posts` method of `user`.

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts
  cache_at :has_post?, ->{ posts.exists? }, expire_by: :posts
end

do_something if current_user.cacher.has_post?
```

In this example, the cache should be cleaned when the `posts` of the user changed. You could just set `expire_by` to the association: `:posts`, and then it will do all the works for you magically. (If you want know more details, it actually set [`expire_by`](#expire_by) to `Post#user_id` and [`foreign_key`](#foreign_key), which is needed for backtracing the user id from post, to `:user_id`)


### Example 4: Pass an argument to the query lambda.

You could cache not only the query result of database but also the result of outer service. Becasue `email_valid?` doesn't match an association or an attribute, by default, the cache will not be cleaned by any changes.

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  cache_at :email_valid?, ->(email){ ValidEmail2::Address.new(email).valid_mx? }
end

render_error if not User.cacher_at('pearl@example.com').email_valid?
```

The query lambda can have one parameter, you could pass variable to it by using `cacher_at`. For example, `User.cacher_at(email)`.

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  cache_at :email_valid?, ->(email){ ValidEmail2::Address.new(email).valid_mx? }, primary_key: :email
end

render_error if not current_user.cacher.email_valid?
```

It can also be accessed from instance cacher. But you have to set [`primary_key`](#primary_key), which is needed to know which attribute should be passed to the parameter.

### Example 5: Store all data in hash

Sometimes you may need to query multiple objects. Although the query results will be cached, the application still needs to query the cache server multiple times. If one communication take 0.1 ms, 1000 communications will take 100ms! For example:

```rb
class Skill < ActiveRecord::Base
  cache_at :atk_power
end

# This will retrieve the data from cache servers multiple times.
@attack = skill_ids.inject(0){|sum, id| sum + Skill.cacher_at(id).atk_power }
```

One of the solution is that you could store a lookup table into cache, so that only one cache object is stored and you can retrieve all of the needed data in one query.

```rb
class Skill < ActiveRecord::Base
  cache_at :atk_powers, ->{ pluck(:id, :atk_power).to_h }, expire_by: 'Skill#atk_power'
end

# This will retrieve the data from cache servers only 1 times.
@attack = skill_ids.inject(0){|sum, id| sum + Skill.cacher.atk_powers[id] }
```

### Example 6: Clean the cache manually

Sometimes it needs to maintain the cache manually. For example, after calling `update_all`, `delete_all` or `import` records without calling callbacks.

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :profile
  cache_at :profile
end

# clean the cache by name
current_user.cacher.clean(:profile)

# or calling the clean_* method
current_user.cacher.clean_profile

# clean the cache without loading model
User.cacher_at(user_id).clean_profile
```

### Example 7: Peek the data stored in cache

If you just want to check the cached objects, but don't want it to load from database automatically when there is no cache. You could use `peek` method on `cacher`.

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :profile
  cache_at :profile
end

# peek the cache by name
current_user.cacher.peek(:profile)

# or calling the peek_* method
current_user.cacher.peek_profile

# peek the cache without loading model
User.cacher_at(user_id).peek_profile
```


## Smart Caching

### Multi-level Cache
There is multi-level cache in order to make the speed of data access go faster.

1. RequestStore
2. Rails.cache
3. Association Cache
4. Database

`RequestStore` is used to make sure same object will not loaded from cache twice, since the data transfer between `Cache` and `Application` still consumes time.

`Association Cache` will be used to prevent preloaded objects being loaded again.

For example:
```rb
user = User.includes(:posts).take
user.cacher.posts # => no query will be made even on cache miss.
```

## Convenient syntax sugar for caching ActiveRecord

### Caching Associations
```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :profile
  cache_at :profile
end

@profile = current_user.cacher.profile

# directly get profile without loading user.
@profile = User.cacher_at(user_id).profile
```

### Caching Polymorphic Associations

TODO

### Caching Self

Cache self by id.
```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  cache_self
end

@user = User.cacher.find_by(id: user_id)

# peek cache
User.cacher.peek_by(id: user_id)

# clean cache
User.cacher.clean_by(id: user_id)
```

Also support caching self by other columns.
```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  cache_self by: :account
end

@user = User.cacher.find_by(account: 'khiav')

# peek cache
User.cacher.peek_by(account: 'khiav')

# clean cache
User.cacher.clean_by(account: 'khiav')
```

### Caching Attributes

```rb
class Profile < ActiveRecord::Base
  cache_at :point
end

@point = Profile.cacher_at(profile_id).point
```

## Options

### :expire_by

Monitor on the specific model. Clean the cached objects if target are changed.

  - if empty, e.g. `nil` or `''`: Monitoring nothing.

  - if string, e.g. `User`: Monitoring all attributes of `User`.

  - if string with keyword `#`, e.g. `User#last_login_in_at`: Monitoring only the specific attribute.

  - if symbol, e.g. `:posts`: Monitoring on the association. It will trying to do all the things for you, including monitoring all attributes of `Post` and set the `foreign_key`.

  - Default value depends on the `name`. If is an association, monitoring the association klass. If is an attribute, monitoring current klass and the attrribute name. If others, monitoring nothing.

### :on

 Fire changes only by a certain action with the `on` option. Like the same option of [after_commit](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Transactions/ClassMethods/after_commit).

  - if `:create`: Clean the cache only on new record is created, e.g. `Model.create`.

  - if `:update`: Clean the cache only on the record is updated, e.g. `model.update`.

  - if `:destroy`: Clean the cache only on the record id destroyed, e.g. `model.destroy`, `model.delete`.

  - if `array`, e.g. `[:create, :update]`: Clean the cache by any of specified actions.

  - Default value is `[:create, :update, :destroy]`

### :foreign_key

This option is needed only for caching assoication and need not to set if [`expire_by`](#expire_by) is set to monitor association. Used for backtracing the cache key from cached objects. For examle, if `user` has_many `posts`, and cached the `posts` by user.id. When a post is changed, it needs to know which column to use (in this example, `user_id`) to clean the cache at user.

  - Default value is `:id`

  - Will be automatically determined if [`expire_by`](#expire_by) is symbol.

### :primary_key

This option is needed to know which attribute should be passed to the parameter when you are using instance cacher. For example, if a query, named `email_valid?`, uses `user.email` as parameter, and you call it from instance: `user.cacher.email_valid?`. You need to tell it to pass `user.email` instead of `user.id` as the argument.

  - Default value is `:id`
